Sort Stack: Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You can use
an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure
(such as an array). The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty
// push into another stack if less that top
// if not then push into s1 stack until it fits then repush them in
// then fill s1 stack again
public void sort(Stack<Integer> s1){

  Stack<Integer> s2 = new Stack<Integer>();
  
  while(!s1.isEmpty()){
    int temp = s1.pop();
    
    while(!s2.isEmpty() && r.peek() > temp){
    
      s1.push(s2.pop());
    }
    s2.push(temp);
  }
  while(!s2.isEmpty()){
  
    s1.push(s2.pop());
  }
}
