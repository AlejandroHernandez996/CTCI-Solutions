URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20: You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
perform this operation in place.)
EXAMPLE
Input: "Mr John Smith    ", 13
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"

// 2 Pointers? One starts at the back one starts where first non whitespace from the back is
// "A B C D     "
//        P2   P1
// Copy over P2 to P1
// Increment P1 and P2
// if P2 is a space
// P2 writes %20
// P2 increments by 3
// Time: O(N)
// Space: O(1)
    public void urlify(char[] url, int n){

    int p1 = n-1;
    int p2 = n-1;
    
    //First find first none white space from the back
    while(url[p1] == ' '){
      p1--;
    }
    // While P1 is still in the array keep copying
    while(p1 > 0 && p2 > 0){
       if(url[p1] != ' '){
        url[p2] = url[p1];
        p1--;
        p2--;
       }
       else{
        url[p2] = '0';
        url[p2-1] = '2';
        url[p2-2] = '%';
        p2 -=3;
        p1--;
       }
    }
}
